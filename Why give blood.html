    <h2 class="page-title">Why give blood</h2>
    <p Giving blood saves lives. The blood you give is a lifeline in an emergency and for people who need long-term treatments.<br>Many people would not be alive today if donors had not generously given their blood.</p>
    <h2>Why we need you to give blood</h2>
    <p>Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.<br>
    Each year we need approximately 200,000 new donors, as some donors can no longer give blood.<br>
    Most people between the ages of 17-65 are able to give blood.<br>
    Around half our current donors are over 45. That's why we need more young people (over the age of 17) to start giving blood, so we can make sure we have enough blood in the future.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Who can give blood</h2>
    <p>Most people can give blood. You can give blood if you:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li> are fit and healthy</li>
    	<li> weigh over 7 stone 12 lbs or 50kg</li>
    	<li> are aged between 17 and 66 (or 70 if you have given blood before)</li>
